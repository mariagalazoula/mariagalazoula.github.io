## About me

My name is Maria Galazoula and I am currently based in Leeds. I am an Integrated MSc and PhD student in the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/)  in the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). My research as a PhD Candidate will focus on diet assessment and optimisation through the use of Big Data and artificial intelligence. 

## Background

Having studied Civil and Geotechnical engineering in one of the most prominent universities in Greece, in the [Civil Engineering Department of the University of Thessaly](http://www.civ.uth.gr/en), I decided to pursue a MSc in the United Kingdom. The MSc I chose to do was in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provided by one of the top Universities in this field, the University of Leeds. Through this master degree, I became familiar with the concept of Data Science and Analytics, which led me to studying modules related to Data Analytics. 

After careful consideration, I applied for one of the Data Science Internships provided by the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/)  based in the University of Leeds. During my time as an intern I got involved in various projects that were related to health. The first project was titled "Developing personalised nutrition: Linking health and consumer data". This project evolved to be my PhD project on which I will focus during my studies. Another project that I was involved in was the LifeInfo Survey, where people were asked whether they would consent to the linkage of consumer and physical activity data to their health data. Finally, the last project that I worked on was the identification of dietary patterns using consumer and physical activity data. This project will lead to the publication of a journal paper.
