## About me

My name is Maria Galazoula and I am currently based in Leeds. I am an Integrated MSc and PhD student in the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/)  in the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). My research as a PhD Candidate will focus on diet assessment and optimisation through the use of Big Data and artificial intelligence. 

## Background

Having studied Civil and Geotechnical engineering in one of the most prominent universities in Greece, in the [Civil Engineering Department of the University of Thessaly](http://www.civ.uth.gr/en), I decided to pursue a MSc in the United Kingdom. The MSc I chose to do was in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provided by one of the top Universities in this field, the University of Leeds. Through this master degree, I became familiar with the concept of Data Science and Analytics, which led me to studying modules related to Data Analytics. 

After careful consideration, I applied for one of the Data Science Internships provided by the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/)  based in the University of Leeds.
